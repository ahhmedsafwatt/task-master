-- =============================================================
-- STORAGE FOLDER STRUCTURE RECOMMENDATIONS
-- =============================================================
-- The RLS policies above assume the following folder structure:
--
-- 1. avatars/
--    └── {user_id}/
--        └── profile.jpg
--
-- 2. project_covers/
--    └── {project_id}/
--        └── cover.jpg
--
-- 3. task-attachments/
--    └── {task_id}/
--        ├── document.pdf
--        ├── image.png
--        └── ...
--
-- These structures are enforced by the RLS policies that check
-- the folder hierarchy with storage.foldername(name)[1]
